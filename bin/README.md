# Binary Directory

This directory contains scripts that are legacy in nature.  No warranties, 
guarantees, or claims are made as to their functionality.  Furthermore, no 
support for them in your particular workflow will be provided.

A note, this directory does purposefully exclude the executable scripts that 
are placed into the [tools](../tools) directory as their place in the workflow 
needs further examination.

## Running

In each script header, this is an example of the call syntax to invoke the script.
